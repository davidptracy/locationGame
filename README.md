This sketch was created for a course at ITP called CloudCommuting. 

The sketch simply compiles all clients geolocation data and displays it in an unordered list in the browser.

The sketch requires node and socket.io.

From the terminal in the same directory as this repository:

"npm install node"
"npm install socket.io"

Followed by:

"node server.js"
